# Isopogon
Documentation for analyses of genomic RADseq data for _Isopogon_ (Proteaceae)  

This repository contains the scripts used for running analyses in Anderson & al. (2024) "Revised taxonomy for two species complexes of Western Australian _Isopogon_ (Proteaceae) using RADseq" (doi: [10.1002/tax.13129](https://doi.org/10.1002/tax.13129))  

Scripts are located in the `scripts` folder, and R markdown files are in the `rmd` folder  
Some additional files that reflect sample and parameter choices are included in the folder `files`  

Raw sequencing data is available from https://data.bioplatforms.com/organization/bpa-plants under dataset 83671, and demultiplexed data is available from the Sequence Read Archive under project PRJNA967108  

The steps for processing the raw data through to end results can be followed in `Isopogon_analyses.md`
